Manages custom token lists for Brave Wallet

## Automated Publishing

We have setup a **weekly** cron job on [Jenkins](https://github.com/brave/devops/blob/master/jenkins/jobs/extensions/brave-core-ext-wallet-data-files-update-publish.yml) that publishes the latest NPM package to wallet data files.

## Development

### Code Quality

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Ubuntu

- Install system dependencies.

  ```bash
  sudo apt install librsvg2-bin libimagequant-dev pkg-config
  ```

- Ensure you have the required node version and `yarn` installed.

- Install dependencies and run the build script.

  ```bash
  yarn
  yarn start
  ```

### MacOS

- Install system dependencies.

  ```bash
  brew install librsvg libimagequant pkg-config
  ```

- Ensure you have the required node version and `yarn` installed.

- Install dependencies and run the build script.

  yarn start
  ```

### Docker

- Install [docker](https://runnable.com/docker/)
- Create a docker image `docker build -t token-lists .`
- Launch the docker image `docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD/build:/token-lists/build" -ti token-lists`
- You will see an output in the `build` folder

## Publishing token list to npm

[brave/brave-core-crx-packager](https://github.com/brave/brave-core-crx-packager) uses the npm package published [here brave-wallet-lists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brave-wallet-lists). It will be automatically published when your
PR is merged and a new release is created.

This produces a zero-dependency package with output images and token lists.

## Testing a deployment

To test wallet data files use the development component updater with a fresh profile.

To do this you can use the command line argument `--use-dev-goupdater-url`.

You can use a clean profile without clearing with this as well: `--user-data-dir=<tmp-dir>`.

If you're using a development build, you can set the dev server via this npmrc environment in `~/.npmrc`:

`updater_dev_endpoint=https://go-updater-dev.bravesoftware.com/extensions`

You can test a deployment by running the Jenkins job named:
`brave-core-ext-wallet-data-files-update-publish-dev`
Please check to make sure it succeeds.

Wait 5-10 minutes as the server will purge its cache during that timeframe and start serving the new component.

Then startup Brave using:
`open -a Brave\ Browser\ Beta.app --args --use-dev-goupdater-url --user-data-dir=$(mktemp -d)`

After things are tested you can run the Jenkins job: `brave-core-ext-wallet-data-files-update-publish` and then after success, test on your normal Brave profile.
The change will be live within 5-10 minutes. Please also test on production.

After testing on production, gives sign off in Slack on `#releases` and `#prod-changes`.

## Troubleshooting deployment
